## Polynomial-Time Reductions and NP-Completeness Theory
 - A polynomial-time reduction is a method for solving one problem using another. One shows that if a hypothetical subroutine solving the second problem exists, then the first problem can be solved by transforming or reducing it to inputs for the second problem and calling the subroutine one or more times. 

 - NP (Non - Deterministic Polynomial Time) is a complexity class used to classify decision problems.NP is the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, where the answer is "yes", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine, or alternatively the set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.

### 1. The Vertex Cover Problem
Problem – Given a graph G(V, E) and a positive integer k, the problem is to find whether there is a subset V’ of vertices of size at most k, such that every edge in the graph is connected to some vertex in V’.

```
VERTEX_COVER = {<G, K> | G is an undirected graph that has k-node vertex cover}.
```

### Vertex Cover is NP-Complete
PROOF:  
An instance of the Vertex Cover problem is a graph G (V, E) and a positive integer k, and the problem is to check whether a vertex cover of size at most k exists in G. Since an NP Complete problem, by definition, is a problem which is both in NP and NP hard, the proof for the statement that a problem is NP Complete consists of two parts:

#### 1. Proof that vertex cover is in NP -
If any problem is in NP, then, given a ‘certificate’ (a solution) to the problem and an instance of the problem (a graph G and a positive integer k, in this case), we will be able to verify (check whether the solution given is correct or not) the certificate in polynomial time.
``` bash
We can check whether the set V’ is a vertex cover of size k using the following strategy (for a graph G(V, E)):

let count be an integer
set count to 0
for each vertex v in V’
    remove all edges adjacent to v from set E
    increment count by 1
    if count = k and E is empty
    then
        the given solution is correct
    else
        the given solution is wrong

It is plain to see that this can be done in polynomial time. Thus the vertex cover problem is in the class NP.
```

#### 2. Proof that vertex cover is NP Hard -

``` bash
Claim: Vertex Cover is NP Hard, we take some problem which has already been proven to be NP Hard, 
and show that this problem can be reduced to the Vertex Cover problem.

For this, we consider the Clique problem, which is NP Complete (and hence NP Hard).

The clique problem is the computational problem of finding cliques (subsets of vertices, all adjacent to each other, 
also called complete subgraphs) in a graph.

Here, we consider the problem of finding out whether there is a clique of size k in the given graph.
Therefore, an instance of the clique problem is a graph G (V, E) and a non-negative integer k, and we need to check for the existence 
of a clique of size k in G.

Now, we need to show that any instance (G, k) of the Clique problem can be reduced to an instance of the vertex cover problem. 
Consider the graph G’ which consists of all edges not in G, but in the complete graph using all vertices in G. 

Let us call this the complement of G. 
```

#### The problem of finding whether a clique of size k exists in the graph G is the same as the problem of finding whether there is a vertex cover of size |V| – k in G’.
``` bash
Assume that there is a clique of size k in G. Let the set of vertices in the clique be V’. 
This means |V’| = k. In the complement graph G’, let us pick any edge (u, v). 
Then at least one of u or v must be in the set V – V’. 

This is because, if both u and v were from the set V’, then the edge (u, v) would belong to V’, 
which, in turn would mean that the edge (u, v) is in G. This is not possible since (u, v) is not in G.
Thus, all edges in G’ are covered by vertices in the set V – V’.

Now assume that there is a vertex cover V’’ of size |V| – k in G’. 
This means that all edges in G’ are connected to some vertex in V’’. 
As a result, if we pick any edge (u, v) from G’, both of them cannot be outside the set V’’. 
This means, all edges (u, v) such that both u and v are outside the set V’’ are in G, i.e., these edges constitute a clique of size k.
```

#### Conclusion -
Thus, we can say that there is a clique of size k in graph G if and only if there is a vertex cover of size |V| – k in G’, and hence, any instance of the clique problem can be reduced to an instance of the vertex cover problem. Thus, vertex cover is NP Hard. Since vertex cover is in both NP and NP Hard classes, it is NP Complete.

### 2. The Subset Sum Problem

``` bash
SUBSET-SUM = {<S, t> | S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} for some {y1, ..., yk} ⊆ {x1, ... xk}, we have  Σyi = t}
```

### SUBSET-SUM is NP-Complete

A 3CNF formula Φ wwe construct an instance of the Subset-Sum problem that contains a collection summing to the target if and only if Φ is satisfiable.
We call this collection T.


PROOF:

Let Φ be a boolean formula with variables x1, x2, ..., xl and clauses c1, ..., ck. 
The reduction converts Φ  to an instance of the SUBSET-SUM problem <S, t>

``` bash
The table is partially filled in to illustrate sample clauses c1, c2 and ck:
    (x1 v x2' v x3) ^ (x2 v x3 v ...) ^ ... ^ (x3' v ... v ...).

Thus S contains one pair of numbers yi, zi,m for each variable xi in Φ .

The decimal representation of these numbers is in two parts.  

The left hand part comprises a 1 followed by l - i 0s.
The right hand part contains 1 digit for each clause, where the jth digit of yi is 1 if clause cj contains literal xi, 
and the jth digit of xi is 1 if clause cj contains the literal xi'. Digits are not specified to be 1 are 0.

Additionally S contains 1 pair of numbers gj, hj for each clause cj. These 2 numbers are equal and consists of 1 followed by k - j 0s.

Finally, the target number t, the bottom row of the table consists of l 1s followed by k 3s.
```

``` bash
Suppose that Φ  is satisfiable. We construct a subset of S as follows:

We select yi if xi is assigned TRUE in the satisfying assignment and zi if xi is assigned FALSE.
If we add up what we hav selected so far, we obtain a 1 in each of the first l digits we have selected either a yi or zi for each i.

Furthermore each of the last k digits is a number between 1 and 3 because each clause is satisfied 
and so contains between 1 and 3 TRUE literals.

Now we further select enough of the g and hg numbers to bring each of the last k digits up to 3, thus hitting the target.

Suppose that a subset sums to t. We construct a satisfying assignment to Φ  after making several observations.

First, all the digits in members of S are either 0 or 1.
Furthermore each column in the table describing S contains at most five 1s.

Hence a "carry" into the next column never occurs when a subset of S is added. 
To get 1 in each of the first l columns the subset must have either yi or zi for each i, but not both.
```

Now, we make the satisfying statement
``` bash
If the subset contains yi, we assign xi TRUE; otherwise, we assign FALSE. 
This assignment must satisfy Φ because in each of the final k columns the sum is always 3.

In column cj, at most 2 can come from gj and hj, so atleast 1 in this column must come from some yior zi in the subset.
 - If it is yi, then xi appears in cj and is assigned TRUE, so cj is satisfied.
 - If it is zi, then xi' appears in cj and xi is assigned FALSE, so cj is satisfied.

Therefore Φ is satisfied.
```

### 3. Polynomial Time Reducibility
A polynomial-time reduction is a method for solving one problem using another. One shows that if a hypothetical subroutine solving the second problem exists, then the first problem can be solved by transforming or reducing it to inputs for the second problem and calling the subroutine one or more times. 

If both the time required to transform the first problem to the second, and the number of times the subroutine is called is polynomial, then the first problem is polynomial-time reducible to the second.

#### A function f: Σ* -> Σ* is a polynomial time complexity function if some polynomial time Turing machine M exists that halts with just f(w) on its tape, when started on any input w.

Language A is polynomial time mapping reducible, or simply polynomial time reducible, to language B, written A <= B, if a polynomial time computable function f: Σ* -> Σ* exists, where for every w,
    w ε A <=> f(w) ε B.  

The function f is called the polynomial time reduction of A to B.

#### - If A <= B and B ε P, then A ε P.
``` bash
Claim: If A <= B and B ε P, then A ε P.

Proof:
"On input w:
    1. Compute f(w)
    2. Run M on input f(w) and output whatever M outputs."
```

#### - 3SAT is polynomial time reducible to CLIQUE where 3SAT = {{Φ} | Φ is a satisfiable 3cnf-formula}.
``` bash
Claim: 3SAT is polynomial time reducible to CLIQUE where 3SAT = {{Φ} | Φ is a satisfiable 3cnf-formula}.

Proof:
Let Φ be a formula with k clauses such as 
    Φ = (a1 v b1 v c1) ^ (a2 v b2 v c2) ^ ... ^ (ak v bk v ck).
The reduction f generates the string <G, k>, where G is an undirected graph defined as follows:

The nodes in G are organized into k groups of three nodes each called the triples, t1, t2, ..., tk. 
Each triple corresponds to one of the clauses in Φ, and each node in a triple corresponds to a literal in the associated clause.
The edges of G connect all but two types of pairs of nodes in G. No edge is present between nodes in the same triple and 
no edges is present between two nodes with contradictory labels, as in x2 and x2'.

Φ is satisfiable if and only if G has a k-clique.
Suppose that Φ has a satisfying assignment. In that satisfying assignment, at least one literal is true in every clause. 
In each triple of G, we select one node corresponding to a true literal in the satisfying assignment. 
If more than one literal is true in a particular clause, we choose one of the true literals arbitrarily.

The nodes just selected form a k-clique. The number of nodes selected is k, because we chose one for each of k-triples. 
Each pair of selected nodes is joined by an edge because no pair fits one of the exceptions described previously.

Suppose that G has a k-clique. No two of the clique's nodes occur in the same triple because nodes in the same triple aren't connected by edges. 
Therefore each of the k-triples contains exactly  one of the k clique nodes.

We assign truth values to the variables of Φ so that each literal labeling a clique node is made true.
Doing so is always possible because two nodes labeled in a contradictory way are not connected by an edge and hence both can't be in a clique.
This assignment to the variables satisfies Φ because each triple contains a clique node and hence each clause contains a literal that is 
assigned true.

Therefore Φ is satisfiable.

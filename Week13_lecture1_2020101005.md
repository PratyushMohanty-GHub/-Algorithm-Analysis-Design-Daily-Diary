## Quantum Algorithms
 - In quantum computing, a quantum algorithm is an algorithm which runs on a realistic model of quantum computation, the most commonly used model being the quantum circuit model of computation.
 - A classical (or non-quantum) algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions, or a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem, where each step or instruction can be performed on a classical computer. Similarly, a quantum algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, where each of the steps can be performed on a quantum computer.

### 1. The Three Polarizer Experiment
One of the experiments that is claimed as an infallible proof of the wave or particle duality theory of quantum mechanics is the three polarizer experiment.
 
 - In this experiment, a light source is shone through a horizontally oriented polarizer and passes on to a light detector.  This means that only horizontally oriented light can pass through the filter, the vertical content is eliminated. In this instance, a strong signal is detected by the detector.
 - In the second stage of the experiment, a second vertical polariser is put in place between the horizontal polariser and the light detector. The vertical polariser blocks out all vertical content.  In this case, the result is that no light passes through to the detector.
 - In the third stage a diagonal polariser replaces the filter placed between the horizontal ( or vertical) polariser and in this case some light passes through to the detector.

 This makes sense because if the vertical polariser blocks all horizontal oriented light and the horizontally oriented polarizer blocks all horizontal light, no light should get through to the detector and this is proved by the experiment.  
 In the same way, when the vertical (or horizontal) filter is replaced by the diagonal filter some light gets through to the detector since obviously some of the vertical light can now get through, this is also perfectly acceptable and is verified through the experimental results.

But if a diagonally oriented polariser is now placed between the vertical polariser and the horizontal polariser, some light is seen to get through to the detector. How can this happen? The vertical component, the horizontal component, AND the diagonal component have all been blocked, how then is it possible for light to still get through to the detector?

This suggests a very simple and inexpensive experiment to demonstrate the notions of quantum states, the projection or representation of a given state vector in another basis set of vectors, the preparation of quantum systems in states with known properties, and the measurement of various properties.

### 2. Qubits

 - In quantum computing, a qubit or quantum bit is the basic unit of quantum information—the quantum version of the classic binary bit physically realized with a two-state device. 
 - A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics. 

Examples include the spin of the electron in which the two levels can be taken as spin up and spin down; or the polarization of a single photon in which the two states can be taken to be the vertical polarization and the horizontal polarization.

 - A quantum bit, or qubit, is a unit vector in a two-dimensional complex vector space for which a particular basis has been fixed and is denoted by:​ {|0>, |1>}.
 - Qubits can be in a superposition of |0› and |1› such as: a|0> + b|0> where a and b are complex numbers such that |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.
 
#### Measuring a Qubit in the Basis  ​- 

``` bash
For the orbit:  a|0> + b|1>
 
 - the probability that the measured value is  |0> is ​|a|^2 
    after which the state collapses to |0>.
 
 - the probability that the measured value is |1› is |b|^2 
    after which the state collapses to |1>.
```

### 3. Postulates of Quantum Mechanics

#### 1. Superposition Postulate
The principle of quantum superposition states that if a physical system may be in one of many configurations—arrangements of particles or fields—then the most general state is a combination of all of these possibilities, where the amount in each configuration is specified by a complex number.

``` bash
For example, if there are two configurations labeled by 0 and 1, the most general state would be
    a|0> + b|1>,  
where the coefficients are complex numbers describing how much goes into each configuration.
```
#### 2. Meausurement & Collapse Postulates
If a system is in a quantum state represented by a wavefunction, then PdV = |Ψ|^2dV is the probability that in a position measurement at time t the particle will be detected in
the infinitesimal volume dV.

``` bash
According to the second postulate of quantum mechanics, the integrated probability density can be interpreted as a 
the probability that in a position measurement at time t, we will find the particle anywhere in space.
```

#### 3. Evolution Postulates
 - Schrodinger Equation
Conceptually, the Schrödinger equation is the quantum counterpart of Newton's second law in classical mechanics. Given a set of known initial conditions, Newton's second law makes a mathematical prediction as to what path a given physical system will take over time. The Schrödinger equation gives the evolution over time of a wave function, the quantum-mechanical characterization of an isolated physical system. The equation can be derived from the fact that the time-evolution operator must be unitary, and must therefore be generated by the exponential of a self-adjoint operator, which is the quantum Hamiltonian.

 - Unitary Transformations
In mathematics, a unitary transformation is a transformation that preserves the inner product: the inner product of two vectors before the transformation is equal to their inner product after the transformation.


### 3. No Cloning Theorem
 - In physics, the no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state, a statement which has profound implications in the field of quantum computing among others.
 - The no-cloning theorem prevents the use of certain classical error correction techniques on quantum states. For example, backup copies of a state in the middle of quantum computation cannot be created and used for correcting subsequent errors. Error correction is vital for practical quantum computing, and for some time it was unclear whether or not it was possible.

``` bash
Assume that U is a unitary transformation that clones, in that U(|a0›) = |aa› for all quantum states |a›.​

Consider |c› = (1/√2)(|a› + |b›).​
Then, ​U(|c0›) = 1/√2 (U(|a0›) + U(|b0›)) = 1/√2(|aa› + |bb›)​

But if U is a cloning transformation then​
    U(|c0›) = |cc› = 1/2(|aa› + |ab› + |ba› + |bb›)​

A contradiction.
```

### 4. Quantum Teleportation
 - Quantum teleportation is a technique for transferring quantum information from a sender at one location to a receiver some distance away. While teleportation is commonly portrayed in science fiction as a means to transfer physical objects from one location to the next, quantum teleportation only transfers quantum information. 
 - The sender does not have to know the particular quantum state being transferred.
 - The objective is to transmit the quantum state of a particle using classical bits and reconstruct the exact quantum state at the receiver.​ It does not contradict the no-cloning theorem.

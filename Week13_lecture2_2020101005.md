## Quantum Algorithms
In quantum computing, a quantum algorithm is an algorithm which runs on a realistic model of quantum computation, the most commonly used model being the quantum circuit model of computation.
## Efficient Integer factorization using Quantum Computers
 - FACTORING is reduced to finding a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo N.​
 - Finding such a root is reduced to computing the order of a random integer modulo N.
 - The order of an integer is precisely the period of a particular periodic superposition.
 - Periods of superpositions can be efficiently found by the quantum FFT.

### Step - 1: FACTORING and non - trivial square root of 1 modulo N.
Lemma: If x is a non-trivial square root of 1 (mod N), then GCD(x + 1, N) is a non-trivial factor.
``` bash
Proof:
    - Let x be a non-trivial square root of 1 (mod N).
    - x^2 = 1 mod N which implies x^2 = 1 (mod N)
    - This means x^2 - 1 = 0 (mod N) i.e. N divides x^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1)
    x != +/- (1 mod N) 
Therefore N must have a nontrivial factor in common with each of (x + 1) and (x - 1).​
```

### Step - 2: Reducing nontrivial square root of 1 to computing the order modulo N.​
``` bash
Order(x): The smallest positive integer r such that x^r = 1 (mod N).

     - Choose a random integer r such that 1 < r < N.
        Assume that gcd(r, N) = 1.
     - If r, the order of x, is even then a nontrivial square root of 1 is: ​x^(r/2)

 Example: 
 If x = 2 and N = 15, then the order of 2 is since 2^4 = 2^2 = 1 (mod 15).
 Raising 2 to half this power, we get a nontrivial square root of 1: 2^2 = 4 != +/- 1 (mod 15).
 So we get a divisor of 15 by computing gcd(4 + 1, 15) = 3.

```

### Step - 3: Computing the order of a random integer modulo N.​
``` bash
    f(a) = x^a mod N

    if r is the order of x, then,
        then f(0) = f(r) = f(2r) = f(3r) = ... = 1
        and f(1) = f(1 + r) = f(1 + 2r) = f(1 + 3r) = ... = x
    
    Thus f is periodic with period r.
```

### Step - 4: Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

 - Fourier Transform of a Periodic vector
 ```
    |a> = sum(sqrt(k/M) | jk>)

    Fourier Transform |b> = (b0, b1, b2, ..., bN)
    where b0 = 1/sqrt(k)sum(|jM/k>)

 - Lemma: Suppose s independent samples are drawn uniformly from: 
        0, M/k, 2M/k, ..., (k-1)M/k
    
    Then with probability at least 1 - k/2^s, the greatest common divisor of these samples is M/k.
```

### The FFT/DFT Matrix
``` bash

Mn(w) = [1  1   1   ...     1]
        [1  w   w^2 ...     w^n - 1]
        [1  w   w^2 ...     w^n - 1]
        .
        .
        [1  w^j   w^2j ...     w^(n - 1)j]
        .
        .
        [1  w^n - 1   w^2(n - 1) ...     w^n - 1(n - 1) ]

Mn(w)^-1 = 1/n(Mn(w^-1))

```
### FFT Algorithm
``` bash
function FFT(a, w):
Input: An array a = (w1, w2, ..., wn) for n a power of 2.
        A primitive nth root of unity w.
Output: Mn(w)a

if w = 1: return a
(s0, s1, ..., sn) = FFT((a0, a1, ..., an - 1), w^2)
(s'0, s'1, ..., sn) = FFT((a1, a3, ..., an - 1), w^2)

for j = 0 to n/2 - 1:
    rj = sj + w^j * s'j
    r(j + n/2) = sj - w^j * s'j

return (r0, r1, ..., rn)
```

### The Complete Code
``` bash
Input: an odd composite number N
Output: a factor of N

1. Choose x uniformly at random in the origin 1 <= x <= N - 1

2. Let M be a power of 2 near N

3. Repeat s = 2logN times:
    Start with 2 quantum registers, both initially 0, the first large enough to store a number mod N.
        Compute f(a) = x^a mod N using the quantum circuit.
        Measure the second register. Now the first register contains the value of periodic superposition 
            |a> = sum(sqrt(r/M) * | jr + k))
        where k is a random offset between 0 and r - 1.
    
    Fourier sample the superposition |a> to obtain an index between 0 and M - 1.

4. Let g be the gcd of the resulting indices j1, j2, ..., js.
    
    If M/g is even, 
        then compute gcd(N, x^M/2g + 1) and  output it if it is a non-trivial factor of N
    else 
        return to step 1.

## BYZANTINE AGREEMENT​
Each process starts with an input from a fixed set V = {0,1}. The goal is for the players to eventually output decisions from the set V upholding the following conditions, even in the presence of an adversary that can Byzantinely corrupt up to any t of the n players:​
 - Agreement: All non faulty processes decide on the same value ​u ε V.
 - Validity: If all non-faulty processes start with the same initial value u Validity: If all non-faulty processes start with the same initial value ​u ε V, then u = v.
 - Termination: All non faulty processes eventually decide.​

### Various Models 
 - Network Model
 - Protocol Model
 - Adversary Model
 - Security Model
 - Inquiry/ Objective Model

### Protocol for 1 out of 4​

The procedure consists of exchange of messages, followed by computation of interactive consistency vector on the basis of result of exchange.

Two round of information exchange is required:
 - In the first round the processors exchange their input values.
 - In the second round they exchange all the values obtained in the first round.

### The Message Matrix
``` bash

        [V11  V12   V13   V14]
        [V21  V22   V23   V24]
        [V31  V32   V33   V34]
        [V41  V42   V43   V44]

- Vij is the message that player i says it received from player j​
- The message matrices differ across players by at most one row & corresponding column
```

### Authenticated Byzantine Agreement (ABA)​
 - Processes are supplemented with “magical powers” to authenticate their communication – Digital Signatures.​
 - Pease et. al. showed that using authentication, fault tolerance can be increased to t < n. ​

### ABA protocol for 1 out of 3​
``` bash

1. Player k maintains a set Wik, for all i of P. Initially Wkk={s} where s is player k’s input value.​
2. Repeat the following steps for 2 rounds:​
    - Receive values from neighbors and for each received value do:​
        - If the message is properly signed, he append its content to the set Wik​
        - Sends i, Wik to his neighbors.​

3. He deletes  Wik if | Wik | != 1.​
4. Since all remaining Wik’s are singleton, he takes majority over all  values. 
    If a majority exists he decides on it, else decides on the default value.​

```

### Connectivity Challenge
 - In a (synchronous) P2P network of n nodes, t of which are (Byzantine) faulty, consensus/agreement is possible only if the network is (2t + 1)-connected.​
 - With cryptography: (t + 1)-connectivity is sufficient.

### Round-Complexity Challenge
In a (synchronous) P2P network of n nodes, t of which are (fail-stop / Byzantine) faulty, consensus requires > t rounds, in the worst case.​

### Other Methods For Consensus
``` bash
1. Block-chain based consensus
    - Proof-of-work based consensus
    - Proof-of-stake consensus

2. Quantum Byzantine Agreement

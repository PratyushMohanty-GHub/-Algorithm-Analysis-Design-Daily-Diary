## Main Facets and questions:
 -  What is a computational problem ?
 -  What are solutions to a computational problem ?
 -  Is the solution correct ? Is it efficient ?
 -  Can we do better than the current solution ?
 -  How to prove Optimality ?

### What is a Computational problem ?
In a computational problem, we are given an input that, without loss of generality, we assume to be encoded over the alphabet {0, 1}, and we want to return as output a solution satisfying some property: a computational problem is then described by the property that the output has to satisfy given the input.
#### Axioms of Computation:
 - It takes non-zero time to retrieve data from far-off locations. i.e. Machines are not omnipresent. It means that information travels at finite speed. If anywhere in solution we assume that information travels at infinite speed then its not a computation problem.
 - Only finite amount of information can be stored/ retrieved from a given vlume. i.e. Machines are not Omniscient​.
 - A finite length of code exerts finite amount of control. i.e. Machines Are Not Omnipotent​. They cannot have infinite control because there are finite number of instructions in a finite length code.

#### Decision Problem
Can we determine if any given statement is provable or non-provable? Output is a single bit (true/ false).

Each decision problem is characterized by a subset of the set of all possible inputs (that is, subset of, say, {0,1}*)​.
INPUT: String x ; OUTPUT: YES if x in language L, else NO​.
Examples:
 - Ex1: Primality Testing​ PRIMES = {n | n is prime}
 - Ex2: Graph Connectivity GC = {Graph G | G is connected}
 - Ex3: Boolean Satisfiability SAT = {CNF Boolean formula f |f is not a fallacy; i.e. f is satisfiable}

#### How do you compare two algorithms ?
In computer science we know that there are multiple techniques of solving a problem:
     - Brute Force
     - Divide and Conquer
     - Greedy
     - Dynamic Programming

One of the ways could be to compare 2 different algorithms would be to actually run them and observe the results. The one which gives you the output in less time would said to be the better one. But, when running these algorithms, you need to ensure that we are using the same hardware for both. A faster processor can give better results for a poorly written algorithm.

#### Factors for comparing algorithms 
So certainly, we want to define some parameters upon which we can compare two algorithms. The important factors are:
 -  Asymptotic analysis:
 -  Time taken by the algorithm
 -  Extra space taken by the algorithm
 -  Worst case/ Best case analysis

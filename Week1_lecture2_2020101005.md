### What is a Computational problem ?
In a computational problem, we are given an input that, without loss of generality, we assume to be encoded over the alphabet {0, 1}, and we want to return as output a solution satisfying some property: a computational problem is then described by the property that the output has to satisfy given the input.
#### Axioms of Computation:
 - It takes non-zero time to retrieve data from far-off locations. i.e. Machines are not omnipresent. It means that information travels at finite speed. If anywhere in solution we assume that information travels at infinite speed then its not a computation problem.
 - Only finite amount of information can be stored/ retrieved from a given vlume. i.e. Machines are not Omniscient​.
 - A finite length of code exerts finite amount of control. i.e. Machines Are Not Omnipotent​. They cannot have infinite control because there are finite number of instructions in a finite length code.

### Are there Computation problems that computers can’t solve?
 Even if one has infinite time and energy and more computing power than could possibly ever exist in the universe there are some things that it will always be impossible for a computer to work out.

Countable sets: An infinite set is countable if there is a bijection f: N -> S from the Natural numbers to set S.
Uncountable sets: A set S is called uncountable if it is not countable.

#### Theorem 1: The set of finite length bit strings {0, 1}* is countable.
Proof Idea: We can strike up the on-one and onto correspondence f: N -> {0, 1}* by listing the string in short-lex order:
```bash
ε 0 1 00 01 10 11 000 001 010 011 100…​
1 2 3 4  5  6  7   8   9   10  11  12…​
```
#### Theorem 2: The power set of bit strings P({0,1}*) is uncountable​.
Proof Idea: Using Cantor’s Diabolical Diagonal​

### Connection to Computing
#### Theorem: There are computational problems that computers cannot solve.

#### Proof:
 -  We know that every computer program can be encoded in binary by some string. Hence the cardinality of the set of programs is no grater than that of {0, 1}*. 
 From the above Theorem_1 we know that {0, 1}* is countable.
 -  Also the problems are (membership queries) in Languages. Hence the set of all the computational problems has the same cardinality as P({0, 1}*). 
 From the above Theorem_2 we know that P({0, 1}*) is uncountable. 
#### Conclusion:
There are uncountably many computational problems. However there are only countable number of computr programs. Hence there must exist at least uncountably many problems for which there are no compter programs that can solve them.

### Church Turing Hypothesis
#### Turing Machine
The Turing machine is defined as an abstract representation of a computing device such as hardware in computers.
Turing Machine is a 7-tuple(Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q0, qaccept, qreject)
 - Q is the finite set of states​
 - Σ is the finite input alphabet set, not containing blank​
 - Γ is the finite tape alphabet, with blank​
 - δ : (Q x Γ)  to  (Q X Γ x {L,R}) is the transition function​
 - q0  is the start state​
 - qaccept is the accept state​
 - qreject is the reject state​

#### Attributes of machines:
 -  Machines are not Omnipresent: It takes non-zero time to retrieve data from far-off locations.​
 -  Machines are not Omniscient​. Only finite information can be stored/retrieved from finite volume​.
 -  Machines are not Omnipotent​. A finite length code only exerts finite amount of control​

# [Algorithm Analysis & Design] Assignment
## Week - 2, Lecture - 1

Some cliched questions about any proposed algorithm are:
- Is it correct ?
- How much time and extra-space does it take as a functino of input sixe n ?
- Can we do better than this? If YES, How? If NOT, Why?

#### 1. N-th Fibonacci number:

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2.

-  #### Algorithm 1 (Using recursion) 
```bash
int fib(int n)
{
    if (n <= 1)
        return n;
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
```
- Time Complexity: T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) which is exponential i.e. O(2^n).
-  #### Algorithm 2 (Using Dynamic Programming) 
```bash
int fib(int n)
{
    int fibo[n + 1];
    fibo[0] = 0;
    fibo[1] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i < n + 1; i++)
        fibo[i] = fibo[i - 1] + fibo[i - 2];
    return fibo[n];
}
```
- Time Complexity: O(n).
-  #### Algorithm 3 (Using power of the matrix {{1, 1}, {1, 0}}) 
```bash
1. We find that: 
    {{F1}, {F2}} = {{0, 1}, {1, 1}} * {{F0}, {F1}}
2. Similarly:
    {{F2}, {F3}} = {{0, 1}, {1, 1}} * {{F1}, {F2}}
    {{F2}, {F3}} = {{0, 1}, {1, 1}}^2 * {{F0}, {F1}}
3. Consequently:
    {{Fn}, {Fn+1}} = {{0, 1}, {1, 1}}^n * {{F0}, {F1}}
```
- Time Complexity: O(log(n)) matrix multiplication suffice.
-  #### Algorithm 4 (Using formula) 
```bash
Fn = (((√5 + 1)/2)^n)/√5 - (((√5 - 1)/2)^n)/√5
```
- Time Complexity: O(log(n)). This is because calculating ((√5 + 1)/2)^n takes log(n) time.

#### 2. Multiplication of large integers:
-  #### Algorithm 1 (Naive Method)
```bash
multiply(a[m], b[n])
{
    product[m + n];
    for (i = 0, i < n; i++)
    {
        carry = 0;
        for (j = 0; j < m; j++)
        {
            product[i + j - 1] += carry + (a[j] * b[i]);
            carry = product[i + j - 1]/10;
            product[i + j - 1] %= 10;
        }
        product[i + n] = carry;
    }
    return product;
}
```
 - Time Complexity: O(m*n), where m and n are length of two number that need to be multiplied. 
 - #### Algorithm 2 (Karatsuba algorithm) 
The algorithm states that to multiply 2 n-digit numbers x and y.
 - First both numbers x and y can be represented as x1, x2 and y1, y2. 
 - x = x1 * B^n + x2, y = y1 * B^n + y2 
 - The product x * y gives the following 4 subproblems: X1 * Y1, X1 * Y2, X2 * Y1 and X2 * Y2
 - We can reduce this to 3 sub-problems thus replacing the initial complexity of O(n^2) by O(n^log(n)).

```bash
Karatsuba(num1, num2)
    1. If (num1 < 10) or (num2 < 10)
        return num1 * num2
    2. Calculate the maximum size of the numbers:
        max_size = max(size(num1), size(num2))
        mid = max_size/2
    3. Split the digit sequences about the middle:
        high1, low1 = split_at(num1, mid)
        high2, low2 = split_at(num2, mid)
    4. Three calls made to numbers approximately half the size:
        n0 = Karatsuba(low1, low2)
        n1 = Karatsuba((low1 + high1), (low2 + high2))
        n2 = Karatsuba(high1, high2)
    5.return (n2 * 10 ^ (2 * mid)) + ((n1 - n2 - n0) * 10 ^ (mid)) + (n0)
```
 - Time Complexity: T(n) <= T(n/2) + T(n/2) + T(1 + (n/2)) + O(n) i.e. O(n^log(3)).

 #### 3. Multiplication of 2 Complex Numbers:

 - How many real multiplications are required to compute (a + ib) * (c + id) ?
 - Naive Answer: 4; (ac - bd) + i(ad + bc).
But we can do this in just 3 multiplications:
```bash
To find (ac - bd) and (ad + bc)
1. Compute a*c
2. Compute b*d
3. Compute (a + b)*(c + d)
(ad + bc) = (a + b)*(c + d) - ac - bd
```

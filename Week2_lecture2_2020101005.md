### Asymptotic Notations

They are mathematical tools to represent the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis:

1) Θ Notation: The Θ notation bounds a functions from above and below, so it defines exact asymptotic behavior.

2) Big O Notation: The Big O notation defines an upper bound of an algorithm, it bounds a function only from above. The Big O notation is useful when we only have upper bound on time complexity of an algorithm.

3) Ω Notation: Ω notation provides an asymptotic lower bound of an algorithm. Ω Notation can be useful when we have lower bound on time complexity of an algorithm. 
### Divide-and-Conquer algorithm

 Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm. A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using following three steps.
 - Divide: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
 - Conquer: Recursively solve these subproblems
 - Combine: Appropriately combine the answers
#### 1. Merge-Sort algorithm
Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms which works on the principle of Divide and Conquer. 
It repeatedly breaks down a list into several sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.

Recursive Solution:
```bash
MergeSort(arr[], l,  r)
  If r > l
     1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:  
             middle m = l+ (r-l)/2
     2. Call mergeSort for first half:   
             Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)
     3. Call mergeSort for second half:
             Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
     4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
             Call merge(arr, l, m, r)
```
Iterative Solution:
```bash
MergeSort(arr[], n)
{
    Q = [] (empty queue)
    for i = 1 to n:
        inject(Q, [ai])
    while |Q| > 1:
        inject (Q, merge(eject(Q), eject(Q)))
    return eject(Q)
}
```
 - The time complexity is given by recurrence relation: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n). 
 - Time complexity of Merge Sort is  θ(nLogn) in all 3 cases (worst, average and best).

#### Merge Sort is Optimal
 - There are n! permutations of an array with n integers.
 - If a sorting algorithm does any k comparaions to sort the n numbers, then we may use it to represent the n! numbers using k-bits.
 - Consequently, k is atleast log(n!).
 - Time Complexity: O(log(n!)) is Ω(nlog(n))
#### 2. Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication

 - In the above divide and conquer method, the main component for high time complexity i.e. O(n^3) is 8 recursive calls. 
 - The idea of Strassen’s method is to reduce the number of recursive calls to 7.
 - It follows divide and conquer method in the sense that this method also divide matrices to sub-matrices of size N/2 x N/2 but the four sub-matrices of result are calculated using a formulae:
```bash
Consider the following matrices A and B:

matrix A = |a b|, matrix B = |e f|
           |c d|             |g h|
Calculate:
    1. a * (f - h)
    2. (a + b) * h
    3. (c + d) * e
    4. d * (g - e)
    5. (a + d) * (e + h)
    6. (b - d) * (g + h)
    7. (a - c) * (e + f)

matrix C = |p5+p4-p2+p6    p1+p2   |
           |   p3+p4    p1+p5-p3-p7| 
```
 - Time Complexity: O(n^log(3)).

#### 3. Median
#### Algorithm 1 (Naive Solution)
 - Merge Sort.
 - Output the mid ranked element.  
 Time Complexity: O(nlog(n)).

#### 4. Generalization to ORDER STATISTICS​
 - Input: A list of numbers S, an integer k.
 - Output: The kth smallest element of S
```bash
For any number v, imagine splitting list S into three categories: ​
- (1) Elements smaller than v, ​
- (2) Those equal to v ​
- (3) Those greater than v. ​
Call these Sl, Sv, and Sr respectively.
```
How do we choose v?
 - A Deterministic approach: Median of Medians
 - Randomized approach - Choose v randomly
```bash
 Algorithm:
 1. Recursively divide the n elements into groups of 5.
 2. Find the median of each of the n/5 groups.
 3. Find the median x of the n/5 medians
 ```
 On detailed analysis we find that: T(n) = O(n).

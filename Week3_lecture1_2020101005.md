### Polynomial Multiplication

Problem: Given 2 d-degree polynomials A(x) and B(x), compute their produc C(x):
 - A(x) = a0 + a1x + ... + ad.(x^d)
 - B(x) = b0 + b1x + ... + bd.(x^d)
 - C(x) = A(x) * B(x) = c0 + c1x + ... c2d.(x^2d) where ck = a0bk + a1b(k - 1) + ... + akb0

#### 1. Naive(Direct Algorithm)
Apply the formula directly.
```bash
multiply_Polynomials(A[d], B[d])
{
   1. Initialize product polynomial with 0.
   product_Polynomial[2d-1];
 
   2. Multiply two polynomials term by term
   for (i = 0; i < d; i++)
     for (int j = 0; j < doesnot; j++)
         product_Polynomial[i+j] += A[i]*B[j]; 
   return prod;
}
```
Time Complexity: O(d^2)

#### 2. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)
Fast Fourier Transformation uses a Divide and conquer srategy to solve the problem of Polynomial Multiplication.
 #### * Selection
 - Pick some points x0, x1, x2, ..., x(n - 1), where n >= 2d + 1.
 - From the complex numbers we know that the equation: x^n = 1 has n complex-solutions(called the n-th roots of unity) and the solutions are of the form w(n, k) = e^((2*k*π*i)/n), where k = 0, 1, ..., (n - 1).

#### * Evaluation
 - Split the d-degree polynomial into 2 (d/2)-degree polynomials: 
  - Its odd and even powers i.e A(x) = Ae(x^2) + x.Ao(x^2). where Ae() - with the even numbered coefficients and Ao - with odd numbered coefficients.

 The discrete Fourier Transform of the polynomial A(x) = (a0, a1, ..., a(n - 1)) is defined as the values of the polynomials at pointsx = w(n, k) i.e.
 DFT(a0, a1,..., a(n−1)) = (A(w(n, 0)), A(w(n, 1)), .., A(w(n, n - 1))).

 - Compute A(x0), A(x1), ..., A(x(n - 1))
 - Compute B(x0), B(x1), ..., B(x(n - 1))
#### * Multiplication
- Compute C(xk) = A(xk) * B(xk) for all k = 0, 1, ..., n - 1

#### * Interpolation
 - Recover C(x) = c0 + c1x + ... + c2d.(x^2d)

 - Similarly, the inverse discrete Fourier transform is defined: The inverse DFT of values of the polynomial (y0, y1,..., y(n−1)) are the coefficients of the polynomial (a0, a1,..., a(n−1)).

When we do A(x) = Ae(x^2) + x.Ao(x^2) we find that w(n, 0)^2, w(n, 1)^2, ..., w(n, n - 1)^2 doesnot contain n-distinct values but n/2 complex n/2th root of unity.
Polynomials A0 and A1 are recursively evaluated at the n complex nth roots of unity. Subproblems have exactly the same form as the original problem, but are half the size. 
```bash
Algorithm
FFT(A, w)
{
    if w = 1:
        return A(1)
    express A(x) in form of Ae(x^2) + x*Ao(x^2)
    call FFT(Ae, w^2) to evaluate at even powers of w.
    call FFT(Ao, w^2) to evaluate at even powers of w.
    for j = 0 to n - 1:
        compute A(w^j) = Ae(w^2j) + w^j * Ao(w^2j)
    return A(w^0), ..., A(w^n - 1)
}

<values> = FFT(<coefficients>, w)
<coefficients> = (1/n)FFT(<values>, w^-1)
```
So recurrence formed is T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n), i.e complexity O(nlogn).

#### 3. Median
#### Algorithm 1 (Naive Solution)
 - Merge Sort.
 - Output the mid ranked element.  
 Time Complexity: O(nlog(n)).

#### 4. Generalization to ORDER STATISTICS​
 - Input: A list of numbers S, an integer k.
 - Output: The kth smallest element of S
```bash
For any number v, imagine splitting list S into three categories: ​
- (1) Elements smaller than v, ​
- (2) Those equal to v ​
- (3) Those greater than v. ​
Call these Sl, Sv, and Sr respectively.
```
How do we choose v?
 - A Deterministic approach: Median of Medians
 - Randomized approach - Choose v randomly
```bash
 Algorithm:
 1. Recursively divide the n elements into groups of 5.
 2. Find the median of each of the n/5 groups.
 3. Find the median x of the n/5 medians
 ```
 On detailed analysis we find that: T(n) = O(n).

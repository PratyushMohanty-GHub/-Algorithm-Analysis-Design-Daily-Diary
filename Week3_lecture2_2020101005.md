## Greedy Algorithms
 - A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that makes the locally optimal choice at each stage. We can make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the sub-problem that may arise later. 
 - It iteratively makes a greedy choice one after the other reducing a given problem to a smaller one.
Although a greedy strategy in many cases maynot produce an optimal solution. This is because sometimes they typically fail to find the global optimal solution as they donot operate exhaustively on all data.
They can be characterized as being short-sighted and also non-recoverable.

### Minimum spanning Tree
We know that:
 - Tree: A tree is a graph with the following properties:
     - The graph is connected.
     - There are no cycles.

 - Spanning Tree: Given a connected undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and joined all vertices. A single graph can have many spanning trees.

 - Minimum Spanning Tree: Minimum Spanning Tree is a Spanning Tree which has minimum total cost. If we have a linked undirected graph with a weight combined with each edge, then the cost of spanning tree would be the sum of the cost of its edges.

### The MSP Problem:
 - Input: An undirected graph G = (V, E); edge weights We.
 - Output: A tree T = (V, E'); where E' is a subset of E that minimizes weight(T) = Σ We.

#### 1. Kruskal's algorithm
The Cut Property:  
Suppose edges X are a part of MST of G = (V, E). Pick any subset of nodes S for which X doesnot cross between S and V - S, let e be the lightest edge across partition then X U {e} is a part of MST.

#### Pseudocode
```bash
1. makeSet(x): creates a singleton set containing just x.
2. find(x): to which set does x belong to ?
3. union(x, y): merge the sets containing x and y.

procedure kruskal(G, w)
    for all u ε V:
        makeSet(u)      

    X = {}
    Sort the edges E by weight
    
    for all edges {u, v} ε E, in increasing order of weight:
        if find(u) != find(v):
            add edge {u, v} to x
            union(u, v)

```
Complexity Analysis:
 - makeSet(x): O(|V|)
 - find(x): O(2|E|)
 - union(x, y): O(|V| - 1)

#### 2. Disjoint-set data structure
A disjoint set is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements/ vertex partitioned into several disjoint subsets. It supports Union and Find operation on subsets.

 - Find: It determines in which subset a particular element is in and returns the representative of that particular set.
 - Union: It merges two different subsets into a single subset, and the representative of one set becomes representative of another.

#### Pseudocode
```bash
procedure makeset(x)
    parent(x) = x
    rank(x) = 0

function find(x)
    while x != parent(x):
        x = parent(x)

procedure union(x, y)
    rx = find(x)
    ry = find(y)

    if (rx == ry): 
        return
    if rank(rx) > rank(ry):
        parent(ry) = rx
    else
        parent(rx) = ry
    
    if rank(rx) == rank(ry):
        rank(ry) = rank(ry) + 1

```
### Properties of rank(x):
 ##### 1. For any x, rank(x) < rank (parent(x))
 ##### 2. Any root node of rank k has atleast 2^k nodes in its tree
 ##### 3. If there are n elements overall, thre can be atmost n/2^k nodes of rank k.
 ##### 4. The highest rank of a node is ≤ ⎣log(n)⎦.
 ##### 5. If x is not a root node, then rank[x] will never change again. 
Complexity analysis:
 - makeSet(x): O(1)
 - find(x): O(log(n))
 - union(x, y): O(log(n))
 - Overall: O((|E| + |V|)log(|V|))

#### We can do better using Path compression:
Modifying find: ​During each find, when a series of parent pointers is followed up to the root of a tree, we will change all these pointers so that they point directly to the root.
```bash
function find(x):
    if x != parent(x):
        parent(x) = find(parent(x))
    return parent(x)
```
#### Analysis: 
1- The time take by a specific find operation is simply the number of pointers followed.

2- Ranks are divided into log*(n) intervals i.e. {1}, {2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6, ..., 2^ 16}, ...

3- Nodes x on the chain(to root) fall into two categories:
 - Type1: Either the rank(parent(x)) is in a higher interval than rank(x). 
 - Type2: Or it is in the same interval.

#### Conclusion: 
Kruskal’s Algorithm using Disjoint-Sets data structure with path compression runs with the complexity of: “Sorting |E| elements” + O(|E| log*|V|)​.

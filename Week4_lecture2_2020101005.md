## Greedy Algorithms
 - A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that makes the locally optimal choice at each stage. We can make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the sub-problem that may arise later. 
 - It iteratively makes a greedy choice one after the other reducing a given problem to a smaller one.
Although a greedy strategy in many cases maynot produce an optimal solution. This is because sometimes they typically fail to find the global optimal solution as they donot operate exhaustively on all data.
They can be characterized as being short-sighted and also non-recoverable.

### Basic Greedy Design
- Greedy Choice Property : Can we know one-first-step towards the optimum solution?
- Optimum Substructure Property : Once the first-step is taken, can we re-state the rest of the problem as a smaller version of the original problem?

### 1. Activity Selection Problem
 - Input: Given N activities with their start and finish times. 
 - Output: Find the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time. 

#### The Greedy Choice and Optimum Substructure:
 - The activity with the least finish time (say a0) belongs to some optimum solution.
 - Solve for the activity selection problem for the activities compatible with the activity a0.​
#### The Greedy Algorithm Approach
     -  Sort the activities according to their finishing time 
     -  Select the first activity from the sorted array and print it. 
     -  Do the following for the remaining activities in the sorted array:
           - If the start time of this activity is greater than or equal to the finish time of the previously  
            selected activity then select this activity and print it.

```bash
Activity-Selection(Activity, start, finish)
     Sort Activity by finish times stored in finish
     Selected = {Activity[1]}
     n = Activity.length
     j = 1
     for i = 2 to n:
         if start[i] ≥ finish[j]:
             Selected = Selected U {Activity[i]}
             j = i
 return Selected
```
#### Time Complexity:
 - If input activities not sorted : O(nlog(n))
 - If input activities sorted: O(n)

### 2. Huffman Codes
 - Huffman code is a data compression algorithm which uses the greedy technique for its implementation. The algorithm is based on the frequency of the characters appearing in a file.
 - Huffman code doesn't use fixed length codeword for each character and assigns codewords according to the frequency of the character appearing in the file.
 - It assigns a shorter length codeword for a character that has a high frequency and a longer length codeword for a character having less frequency.

#### Variable-Length encoding:
 Prefix-free property: In variable length codeword, we only use such code which are not the prefix of any other character and these codes is known as prefix codes.Using prefix codes made decoding unambiguous.

#### The Precise problem:
 - Given the frequencies f1,f2, … ,fn of n symbols, we want a tree whose leaves each correspond to a symbol and which minimizes the overall length of the encoding​.
 - Cost of the tree = Σfi * (depth of the ith symbol in the tree)

#### The Greedy Choice and Optimum Substructure:
 - The two symbols with the smallest frequencies must be at the bottom of the optimal tree, as children of the lowest internal node.
 - Define the frequency of any internal node to be the sum of the frequencies of its descendant leaves and the cost of the tree is the sum of the frequencies of all leaves and internal nodes, except the root.

#### Pseudocode
```bash
 Input: An array f[1...n] of frequencies.
 Output: An encoding tree with n leaves.

 procedure Huffman(f)
    let H be a priority queue of integers ordered by f
    for i = 1 to n:
        insert(H, i)
    for k = n + 1 to 2n - 1:
        i = deletemin(H), j = deletemin(H)
        create a node numbered k with children i, j
        f[k] = f[i] + f[j]
        insert(H, k)
```
#### Time Complexity:
 - Encoding: O(nlog(n)).
 - Extraction: O(nlog(n)).
#### Applications:
 - They are used for transmitting fax and text.
 - They are used by conventional compression formats like PKZIP, GZIP, etc.

## Greedy Algorithms
 - A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that makes the locally optimal choice at each stage. We can make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the sub-problem that may arise later. 
 - It iteratively makes a greedy choice one after the other reducing a given problem to a smaller one.
Although a greedy strategy in many cases maynot produce an optimal solution. This is because sometimes they typically fail to find the global optimal solution as they donot operate exhaustively on all data.
They can be characterized as being short-sighted and also non-recoverable.

### 1. Set Cover Problem
 - Set-Cover: Given a domain X of n points, and m subsets S1, S2, . . . , Sm of these points. 
 - Goal: find the fewest number of these subsets needed to cover all the points. The decision problem also provides a number k and asks whether it is possible to cover all the points using k or fewer sets

#### Actual Problem:
 - Input: Given a set of elements U = {1, 2, 3, ..., n} called the universe and a collection S of m sets whose union equals to U. 
 - Output: Find the smallest sub-collection of S whose unino equals the universe U.

Example: If U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and the collection of sets S = {{1, 2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}}. Clearly the usion of S is U. However we can cover all the elements of U with the following minimum number of sets: {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}}.
 
#### Set Cover is NP-Hard and NP-Complete:
A problem X is a NP-Hard problem when every problem Y in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to X assuming that X takes 1 unit of time. The following problems are NP-Hard:
 - Set Cover Problem
 - Vertex Cover Problem
 - Travelling Salesman Problem

#### The Greedy Algorithm Approach
    There is a greedy algorithm for polynomial time approximation of set covering that chooses sets according to 1 rule:
    "At each stage, choose the set that contains the largest number of uncovered elements".

     1.  Let at any time I represents the set of elements included so far. Initialize I = {}.
     2.  Do the following for the remaining elements while I is not same as U:
           a. Choose the set that contains the largest number of uncovered elements.
           b. Add the elements of above picked Si to I, i.e. I = I U Si.

#### Pseudocode 
```bash
Input: Given a set of elements U and a collection S of m sets whose union equals to U. 
Output: Find the smallest sub-collection of S whose unino equals the universe U.

Greedy-Set-Cover(U, S)
     Initialize: I = {}

     while U != {}:
         select an Si ε F that maximizes |Si ∩ S|
         U = U - Si
         I = I ∪ {Si}
    return I
```

#### Greedy is Not Optimum Always
The greedy algorithm may not provide the optimal solution all the time. If we consider the following example:
```bash
Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
and S = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 6}}

In this case greedy algorithm picks all the 3 and produces result as {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 6}.

But the Optimum solution is: {1, 3, 5} and {2, 4, 6}.
```

#### Greedy is O(log(N)) Approximate

THEOREM: If the optimal solution uses k sets, the greedy algorithm finds a solution with at most klog(n) sets.

PROOF: 
 - Since the optimal solution uses k sets, there must some set that covers at least a 1 / k fraction of the points. The algorithm chooses the set that covers the most points, so it covers at least that many. 
 - Therefore, after the first iteration of the algorithm, there are at most n * (1 − 1 / k) points left. 
 - Again, since the optimal solution uses k sets, there must some set that covers at least a 1 / k fraction of the remainder. Since we choose the set that covers the most points remaining, after the second iteration, there are at most n * (1 − 1 / k)^2 points left. 
 - Thus we can say that, after t = klog(n) rounds we must be done.

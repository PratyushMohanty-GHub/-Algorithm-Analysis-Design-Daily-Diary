## Dynamic Programming
 - Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. 
 - The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
 - DP algorithm solves each subproblem just once and then remembers its answer, thereby avoiding re-computation of the answer for similar subproblem every time.


### Edit Distance Problem
 - Given two strings A and B and below operations that can performed on A. Find minimum number of edits operations required to convert A into B. The operations are:  1) Insert 2) Remove 3) Replace
 - All of the above operations are of equal cost where the cost of an alignment is the number of columns in which letters differ. 
 - The Edit distance between 2 strings A and B is the cost of their best possible alignment.

#### What are the Sub-Problems?
If we traverse from right corner of both the strings, there are 2 possibilities for every pair of 
character being traversed.  

 -  If the last characters of the 2 strings A and B are same, ignore the last characters and recur for lengths len(A) - 1 and len(B) - 1.

 -  If last characters are not same  consider all operations on A, consider all three operations on last character of first string, recursively compute minimum cost for all three operations and take minimum of three values. 
      - Insert: Recur for len(A) and len(B) - 1;
      - Remove: Recur for len(A) - 1 and len(B); and
      - Replace: Recur for len(A) - 1 and len(B) - 1.

#### Algorithm1 (Recursive Approach) Pseudocode
``` bash 
int editDist(string A, string B, int len(A), int len(B))
{
    if (A == "")
        return len(B);
    if (B == "")
        return len(A);
 
    if (last characters of the 2 strings A and B are same)
        return editDist(A, B, len(A) - 1, len(B) - 1);
    else
    {
        return 1 + min(editDist(A, B, len(A), len(B) - 1),
                       editDist(A, B, len(A) - 1, len(B)),
                       editDist(A, B, len(A) - 1, len(B) - 1);
    }
}
```
#### Time Complexity : 
 - Time complexity of this recursive approach is exponential i.e. O(3^n).

#### Algorithm 2 (Dynamic Programming)
There are many subproblems in the above recursive solution which are solved again and again. So this problem has Overlapping Substructure property and recomputation of same subproblems can be avoided by either using Memoization or Tabulation.

#### Approach
``` bash
int count(string A, string B)
{
    int m = len(A);
    int n = len(B);
    for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
        v[i][0] = i;
    }
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
        v[0][j] = j;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) 
        {
            if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]) 
                v[i][j] = v[i-1][j-1];
            else 
                v[i][j] = 1 + min(min(v[i][j-1],v[i-1][j]),v[i-1][j-1]);
        }
    }
    return v[m][n];
}
```
#### Time Complexity:
 - Time Complexity of this approach is: O(len(A) * len(B)).

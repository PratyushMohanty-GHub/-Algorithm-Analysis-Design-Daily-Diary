## Dynamic Programming
 - Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. 
 - DP algorithm solves each subproblem just once and then remembers its answer, thereby avoiding re-computation of the answer for similar subproblem every time.

### 1. Chain Matrix Multiplication
- The Matrix Chain Multiplication is an optimization problem to find the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices
- The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the multiplications.

#### Actual Problem:
Input: Given array of integers M representing a chain of 2-D matrices such that the dimension of the ith matrix is M[i - 1] * M[i].

Output: Return the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply the chain.

 
#### 1. Algorithm1 (Recursive Approach) Pseudocode
``` bash 
int matrixChainMultiplication(int M[], int sI, int eI)
{
    if (sI == eI)
        return 0;

    int minAns = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = sI; i < eI; i++)
    {
        int shortAns =  matrixChainMultiplication(M, sI, i) +
                        matrixChainMultiplication(M, i + 1, eI) +
                        M[sI - 1] * M[i] * M[eI];
        minAns = min(minAns, shortAns);
    }
    return minAns;
}
```
#### Complexity Analysis: 
 - Time complexity of this recursive approach is exponential i.e. O(2^n).
 - Auxiliary Space : O(1)
#### 2. Algorithm 2 (Dynamic Programming)
There are many subproblems in the above recursive solution which are solved again and again. So this problem has Overlapping Substructure property and recomputation of same subproblems can be avoided by either using Memoization or Tabulation.

#### Memoization Approach
``` bash
int matrixChainMultiplication(int M[], int sI, int eI, int dp[][])
{
    if (sI == eI)
        return 0;
    if (dp[sI][eI] != -1)
        return dp[sI][eI];

    int minAns = INT_MAX;
    dp[sI][eI] = minAns;
    for (int i = sI; i < eI; i++)
    {
        int shortAns =  matrixChainMultiplication(M, sI, i) +
                        matrixChainMultiplication(M, i + 1, eI) +
                        M[sI - 1] * M[i] * M[eI];
        minAns = min(minAns, shortAns);
        dp[sI][eI] = minAns;
    }
    return dp[sI][eI];
}
```

 ### 2. Knapsack Problem
Input: Given two integer arrays value[] and weight[] which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively

Output: Find out the maximum value subset of value[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.

#### 1. Algorithm1 (Recursive Approach) Pseudocode
``` bash 
int knapSack(int capacity , int weight[], int value[], int n)
{
    if (n == 0)
        return 0;
    if (capacity == 0)
        return 0;
 
    if (weights[n - 1] <= capacity)
    {
        return  max(value[n - 1] + 
                    knapSack(capacity - weight[n - 1], weight, value, n - 1),
                    knapSack(capacity, weight, value, n - 1));
    }
    else
    {
        return knapSack(capacity, weight, value, n - 1);
    }
}
```
#### Complexity Analysis : 
 - Time complexity of this recursive approach is exponential i.e. O(2^n).
 - Auxiliary Space : O(1)

 There are many subproblems in the above recursive solution which are solved again and again. So this problem has Overlapping Substructure property and recomputation of same subproblems can be avoided by either using Memoization or Tabulation.
#### 2. Algorithm 2 (Dynamic Programming) Approach
 We can use Memoization which is an extension to recursive approach so that we can overcome the problem of considering the redundant cases and hance increased time complexity.

#### Developing a DP Algorithm for Knapsack
 -  Decompose the problem into smaller problems.
 -  Recursively define the value of an optimal solution in terms of solutions to smaller problems

#### Pseudocode
``` bash
int knapSack(int capacity , int weight[], int value[], int n, int dp[][])
{
    if (n  == 0)
        return 0;
    if (dp[n - 1][capacity] != -1)
        return dp[n - 1][capacity];
 
    if (weights[n - 1] <= capacity)
    {
        dp[n - 1][capacity] =  max(value[n - 1] + 
                                knapSack(capacity - weight[n - 1], weight, value, n - 1),
                                knapSack(capacity, weight, value, n - 1));
        return dp[n - 1][capacity];
    }
    else
    {
        dp[n - 1][capacity] = knapSack(capacity, weight, value, n - 1);
        return dp[n - 1][capacity];
    }
}
```
#### Complexity Analysis : 
 - Time complexity : O(N*W) where ‘N’ is the number of weight element and ‘W’ is capacity.
 - Auxiliary Space : O(N*W)

## Number Theoritic Algorithms

### 1. Greatest Common Divisor
- The Greatest common divisor is that number which completely divides two or more numbers without leaving any remainder. 
- Therefore, it is also known as the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two numbers.

#### Algorithm - 1
``` bash
Input: Two integers N and M with N >= M >= 0
Output: GCD(N, M)

int GCD(int N, int M)
{
    int ans;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N && i <= M; i++)
    {
        if (N % i == 0 && M % i == 0)
        {
            ans = i;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
#### Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD 

 - If we subtract a smaller number from a larger (we reduce a larger number), GCD doesn’t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
 - Now instead of subtraction, if we divide the smaller number, the algorithm stops when we get remainder 0.

#### Algorithm - 2
``` bash
Input: Two integers N and M with N >= M >= 0
Output: GCD(N, M)

int GCD(int N, int M)
{
    if (N == 0)
        return M;
    if (M == 0)
        return N;
    if (N == M)
        return N;
    if (N > M)
        return GCD(N - M, M);
    else
        return GCD(N, M - N);
}
```
#### Algorithm - 3
``` bash
Input: Two integers N and M with N >= M >= 0
Output: GCD(N, M)

int GCD(int N, int M)
{
    if (M == 0)
        return N;
    return gcd(M, N % M);
}
```
Time Complexity: O(log(min(M, N))).

####  - If N and M are positive integers with N >= M, then GCD(N, M) = GCD(N % M, M).
 
Proof:  
 - It is enough to show that GCD(N, M) = GCD(N - M, M) from which the one stated can be derived repeatedly subtracting M from N.  
 - Any integer that divides both N and M must also divide N - M, so GCD(N, M) <= GCD(N - M, M).  
 - Also any integer that divides both N - M and M must divide both N ans M, so GCD(N, M) >= GCD(N - M, M).

#### - Lemma: If N >= M, then N % M < N/2

Proof:  
 - Witness that we have two cases. Either M <= N/2 or M > N/2. If M <= N/2 then we have N % M < M <= N/2, and if N % M = N - M < N/2. 

### 2. Extended Euclid's Algorithm
Extended Euclidean algorithm also finds integer coefficients x and y such that:  ax + by = GCD(a, b) 

#### How is Extended Algorithm Useful? 
The extended Euclidean algorithm is particularly useful when a and b are coprime i.e. GCD(a, b) = 1. Since x is the modular multiplicative inverse of a % b, and y is the modular multiplicative inverse of b % a. 

In particular, the computation of the modular multiplicative inverse is an essential step in RSA public-key encryption method.

#### - Lemma: For any positive integers a and b the extended-Euclid's algorithm returns integers x, y and d such that GCD(a, b) = d = ax + by. 

#### - Lemma: If d divides both a and b, and d = ax + by for some integer x and y, then d = GCD(a, b).

Proof:  
 - By the first two conditions d is a common divisor of a and b so, it cannot exceed the greatest common divisor that is d <= GCD(a, b).  
 - On the other hand, since GCD(a, b) is a common divisor of a and b, it must also divide ax + by = d, which implies a, b <= d. Putting these together d = GCD(a, b).

#### The Algorithm
``` bash 
Input: Two positive integers a and b with a >= b >= 0.
Output: Integers x, y, d such that d = GCD(a, b) and ax + by = d.

function extended-Euclid(a, b)

    if (b == 0)
        return (1, 0, a)
    (x', y', d) = extended-Euclid(b, a % b)
    return (y', x' - (a/b)y', d)

```
### 3. Modular Division

#### Modular division theorem:
 - For any a % N, a has a multiplicative inverse modulo N if and only if it is relatively prime to N.
 - When this inverse exists it can be found in time O(n^3) (where n denotes the number of bits of N) by running the extended-Euclid's Algorithm.

### 4. Public-Key Cryptography
- Public-key cryptography is an encryption scheme that uses two mathematically related, but not identical, keys - a public key and a private key. 
- Unlike symmetric key algorithms that rely on one key to both encrypt and decrypt, each key performs a unique function. 
- The public key is used to encrypt and the private key is used to decrypt.

#### Ease/ Speed of Operation
``` bash
Ease/ Speed of the operation depends on the Representation

                Addition    Multiplication      Comparaion
Roman           Slow        Slow                Slow
Decimal         Fast        Medium              Fast
Prime Product   Slow        Fast                Medium
Residue System  Fast        Fast                Medium

```

### 5. RSA Cryptosystem
- This cryptosystem is one the initial system. It remains most employed cryptosystem even today. 
- The system was invented by three scholars Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman and hence, it is termed as RSA cryptosystem.

``` bash
Pick any two primes p and q and let N = pq.​

For any e relatively prime to (p -1)(q - 1):​
    - The mapping f(x) =  xe mod N is a bijection on {0, 1, ..., N - 1} ​
    - Moreover, the inverse mapping is easily realized: 
        let d be the inverse of e modulo (p -1)(q - 1). ​

Then for all x in {0, 1, ..., N - 1} : (x^e)^d (mod N) ≡ x (mod N)​
```
#### RSA - Correctness
``` bash
RSA - Correctness:
(x^e)^d - x = x ^(1 + k(p - 1)(q - 1)) - x is always 0 (mod N).

The 2nd form of the expression is convinient because it can be simplified using the Fermats 
Little Theorem. It is divisible by p (since x ^ (p - 1) ≡ 1 mod p) and likewise divisible by q.

Since p and q are primes, this expression must also be divisible by their product N. Hence 
(x^e)^d - x = x ^(1 + k(p - 1)(q - 1)) - x ≡ 0 (mod N).
```

### 6. Fermat's Little Theorem
``` bash
Fermats Little Theorem
 - If p is prime, then for every 1 <= a < p, a^(p - 1) ≡ 1 mod p.
```
``` bash
The Numbers a.i (mod p) are Distinct:

This is because if a.i ≡ a.j(mod p) then dividing both sides by a gives i ≡ j (mod p). They are
non-zero because a.i ≡ 0 similarly implies i ≡ 0. And we can divide by a because by assumption
it is non-zero and therefore relatively prime to p.
    - {1, 2, ..., p - 1} = {a.1 mod p, a.2 mod p, ..., a.(p - 1) mod p}
    - (p - 1)! ≡ a^(p - 1) . (p - 1)! (mod p) 
```

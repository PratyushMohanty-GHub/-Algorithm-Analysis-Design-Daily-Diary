## Number Theoritic Algorithms
###  Primality Testing
A Primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime i.e. Given a number n, check if it is prime or not.  
Among other fields of mathematics, it is used for cryptography. Unlike integer factorization, primality tests do not generally give prime factors, only stating whether the input number is prime or not.

### 1. Algorithm - 1 : Iterative Method
We iterate through all numbers i = 2 to i = N - 1 and for every number check if N % i == 0. 
If for any number i, N % i == 0 i.e. it completely divides N, then we return false. Else we return true. 

``` bash
Input: Integer N
Output: Check if N is a Prime or not

bool isPrime(int n)
{
    if ( N <= 1)
        return false;
 
    for (int i = 2; i < N; i++)
    {    if (N % i == 0)
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
Time Complexity: O(N)

### 2. Algorithm - 2 : Using Fermat's Little Theorem
``` bash
Fermats Little Theorem
 - If p is prime, then for every 1 <= a < p, a^(p - 1) ≡ 1 mod p.
```
``` bash
The Numbers a.i (mod p) are Distinct:

This is because if a.i ≡ a.j(mod p) then dividing both sides by a gives i ≡ j (mod p). They are
non-zero because a.i ≡ 0 similarly implies i ≡ 0. And we can divide by a because by assumption
it is non-zero and therefore relatively prime to p.
    - {1, 2, ..., p - 1} = {a.1 mod p, a.2 mod p, ..., a.(p - 1) mod p}
    - (p - 1)! ≡ a^(p - 1) . (p - 1)! (mod p) 
```

### 3. Algotithm - 3 : Miller–Rabin primality test
So far, we know of two ways to prove that a number n is composite:
 -  Exhibit a factorization n = ab, where a, b > 1.
 -  Exhibit a Fermat witness for n, i.e. a number x satisfying x ^ (n−1) !≡ 1 mod n
The Miller-Rabin test is based on a third way to prove that a number is composite.
 -  Exhibit a “fake square root of 1 mod n,” i.e. a number x satisfying x ^ 2 ≡ 1 mod n but x !≡ +/-1 mod n.

``` bash
Input: Two integers N and M with N >= M >= 0
Output: GCD(N, M)

bool isPrime(int N)
{
    If N is even:
    {
        if (N == 2):
            Accept
        else
            Reject
    }

    Select a1, a2, ..., ak randomly in Z+
        for each i from 1 to k:
        {
            Compute ai ^ (p - 1) mod p
            if (ai ^ (p - 1) mod p != 1):
                Reject
            else
            {
                Let p - 1 = st, where s is odd and t = 2 ^ h
                Compute the sequence:
                    ai ^ (s.2^0), ai ^ (s.2^1), ..., ai ^ (s.2^h) mod p
                
                If some element of this sequence != 1
                {
                    find the last element != 1 and 
                    Reject if that element != -1
                }
            }
        }
    All tests have passed at this point so Accept
}
```

### - To Prove: If p is an odd prime, Pr[PRIME accepts p] = 1.
#### Proof:
``` bash
We first show that if p is a prime, no witness exists and so no branch of the algorithm rejects.

If a were a stage of 4 witness, 
    (a ^ (p - 1) mod p) != 1 and Fermats Little Theorem implies that p is composite.
If a were a stage 7 witness, 
    some b exists in Z+ where b !≡ +/-1 mod p and b ^ 2 ≡ 1 mod p.
Therefore b^2 - 1 ≡ 0 mod p.

Factorizing b^2 - 1 yields:
    (b - 1)(b + 1) ≡ 0 mod p
which implies that 
    (b - 1)(b + 1) = cp for some +ve integer c.

Because b !≡ +/-1 mod p, both (b - 1) and (b + 1) are strictly between 0 and p.Therefore, p is a composite 
because a multiple of prime number cannot be expressed as a product of numbers that are similar than it is. 
```

### - To Prove: If p is a composite number, Pr[PRIME accepts p] <= 2 ^ (-k)
#### Proof:
``` bash
We show that, if p is an odd composite and a is selected randomly in Z+, 
    Pr[a is witness] >= 1/2
by demonstrating that at least as many witnesses as non-witnesses exists in Z+.

We do so by finding a unique witness for each non-witness.

In every non-witness, the sequence computed in stage 6 is either all 1s or contrains -1 at some position, 
followed by 1s.

For example, 1 itself is a non-witness of the first kind and -1 is a non-witness of the second kind because 
s is odd and -1 ^ (s.2^0) ≡ -1 and -1 ^ (s.2^1) ≡ 1. Among all non-witnesses of the second kind, find a 
non-witness for which the -1 appears in the largest position in the sequence.

Let h be that non-witness and let j be the position of -1 in its sequence, where the sequence positions are
numbered starting at 0. 
Hence h ^ (s.2^j) ≡ -1 mod p.

Because p is composite, either p is the power of a prime or we can write p as a product of q and r, 2 numbers 
that are relatively prime.
```

#### - Consider the Later Case:
``` bash
The Chinese Remainder Theorem implies that some number t exists in Z+ whereby,
    t ≡ h mod q and t ≡  1 mod r

Therefore 
    t ^ (s.2^j) ≡ -1 mod q
    and t ^ (s.2^j) ≡ 1 mod r

Hence t is a witness because t ^ (s.2^j) !≡ +/-1 mod p but t ^ (s.2^(j + 1)) ≡  1 mod p.
Now that we have one witness, we can get many more.
We prove that dt mod p is a unique witness for each non-witness d by making two observations.

1.  First, d ^ (s.2^j) ≡ +/-1 mod p and d ^ (s.2^(j + 1)) ≡ 1 mod p owing to the way j was chosen.
    Therefore, dt mod p is a witness because dt ^ (s.2^j) !≡ +/-1 and dt ^ (s.2^(j + 1)) ≡ 1 mod p.

2.  Second, if d1 and d2 are distinct non-witnesses d1t mod p != d2t mod p.
    The reason is that t ^ (s.2^(j + 1)) mod p = 1. Hence t.t ^ (s.2^(j + 1) - 1) mod p = 1.
    Therefore if td1 mod p = td2 mod p then, 
        d1 = t.t ^ (s.2^(j + 1) - 1)d1 mod p = t.t ^ (s.2^(j + 1) - 1)d2 mod p = d2.

Thus the number of witnesses must be as large as the number of non-witnesses and we have completed the analysis
for the case where p is not a prime power.
```
####  - For the Prime Power Case: 
``` bash
We Have p = q ^ e, Where q Is Prime And e > 1

Let t = 1 + q ^ (e - 1). 
Expanding t ^ e using the binomial theorem we obtain 
    t ^ p = (1 + q^(e - 1))^p = 1 + p.q^(e - 1) + multiples of higher powers of q ^ (e - 1), 
which is equivalent to 1 mod p.

Hence t is a stage 4 witness because if t ^ (p - 1) ≡ 1 mod p, then t ^ p ≡ t !≡ 1 mod p.
As in the previous case, we used this one witness to get many others.

If d is a non-witness, 
    We have d ^ (p - 1) ≡ 1 mod p but then dt mod p is a witness.
Moreover if d1 nd d2 are distinct non-witnesses then 
    d1t mod p != d2t mod p.
Otherwise 
    d1 = d1.t.t^(p - 1) mod p = d2.t.t ^ (p - 1) mod p = d2

Thus the number of witnesses must be as large as the number of non-0-witnesses and the proof is complete.

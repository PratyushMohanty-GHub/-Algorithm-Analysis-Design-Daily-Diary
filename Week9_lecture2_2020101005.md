## Polynomial-Time Reductions and NP-Completeness Theory
 - A polynomial-time reduction is a method for solving one problem using another. One shows that if a hypothetical subroutine solving the second problem exists, then the first problem can be solved by transforming or reducing it to inputs for the second problem and calling the subroutine one or more times. 

 - NP (Non - Deterministic Polynomial Time) is a complexity class used to classify decision problems.NP is the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, where the answer is "yes", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine, or alternatively the set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.

### 1. Polynomial - Time Verifiable Languages
A verifier for a language A is an alogorithm V, where 
 A = {w | V accepts <w, c> for some string c}.

We measure the time of a verifier only in terms of the length of w, so a polynomial time verifier runs in polynomial time in length of w.
A language A is polynomially verifiable if it has a polynomial time verifier.

### 2. Class NP
 NP is th class of languages that have polynomial time verifiers.

#### Examples:
``` bash
1. CLIQUE = {<G, k> | G is an undirected graph with a k-clique}.

Proof:
V = "On input <<G, k>, c>:
    1. Test whether c is a set of k nodes in G.
    2. Test whether G contains all edges connecting nodes in c.
    3. If both pass, accept; otherwise reject."
```
``` bash
2. SUBSET-SUM = {<S, t> | S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} and for some {y1, y2, ..., yl} ⊆ {x1, ..., xk}, we have Σyi = t}.

Proof:
The following is a verifier V for SUBSET-SUM:
V = "On input <<S, t>, c>:
    1. Test whether c is a collection of numbers that sum to t.
    2. Test whether S contains all the numbers in c.
    3. If both pass, accept; otherwise, reject."
```
#### NP versus co-NP

Observe that the complements of theses sets, CLIQUE' and SUBSET-SUM', are not obviously members of NP. Verifying that something is not present seems to be more difficult that verifying that it is present.
We make a separate complexity class called co-NP, which contains the languages that are complements of languages in NP.

### 3. Polynomial Time Reducibility
A polynomial-time reduction is a method for solving one problem using another. One shows that if a hypothetical subroutine solving the second problem exists, then the first problem can be solved by transforming or reducing it to inputs for the second problem and calling the subroutine one or more times. 

If both the time required to transform the first problem to the second, and the number of times the subroutine is called is polynomial, then the first problem is polynomial-time reducible to the second.

#### A function f: Σ* -> Σ* is a polynomial time complexity function if some polynomial time Turing machine M exists that halts with just f(w) on its tape, when started on any input w.

Language A is polynomial time mapping reducible, or simply polynomial time reducible, to language B, written A <= B, if a polynomial time computable function f: Σ* -> Σ* exists, where for every w,
    w ε A <=> f(w) ε B.  

The function f is called the polynomial time reduction of A to B.

#### - If A <= B and B ε P, then A ε P.
``` bash
Claim: If A <= B and B ε P, then A ε P.

Proof:
"On input w:
    1. Compute f(w)
    2. Run M on input f(w) and output whatever M outputs."
```

#### - 3SAT is polynomial time reducible to CLIQUE where 3SAT = {{Φ} | Φ is a satisfiable 3cnf-formula}.
``` bash
Claim: 3SAT is polynomial time reducible to CLIQUE where 3SAT = {{Φ} | Φ is a satisfiable 3cnf-formula}.

Proof:
Let Φ be a formula with k clauses such as 
    Φ = (a1 v b1 v c1) ^ (a2 v b2 v c2) ^ ... ^ (ak v bk v ck).
The reduction f generates the string <G, k>, where G is an undirected graph defined as follows:

The nodes in G are organized into k groups of three nodes each called the triples, t1, t2, ..., tk. 
Each triple corresponds to one of the clauses in Φ, and each node in a triple corresponds to a literal in the associated clause.
The edges of G connect all but two types of pairs of nodes in G. No edge is present between nodes in the same triple and 
no edges is present between two nodes with contradictory labels, as in x2 and x2'.

Φ is satisfiable if and only if G has a k-clique.
Suppose that Φ has a satisfying assignment. In that satisfying assignment, at least one literal is true in every clause. 
In each triple of G, we select one node corresponding to a true literal in the satisfying assignment. 
If more than one literal is true in a particular clause, we choose one of the true literals arbitrarily.

The nodes just selected form a k-clique. The number of nodes selected is k, because we chose one for each of k-triples. 
Each pair of selected nodes is joined by an edge because no pair fits one of the exceptions described previously.

Suppose that G has a k-clique. No two of the clique's nodes occur in the same triple because nodes in the same triple aren't connected by edges. 
Therefore each of the k-triples contains exactly  one of the k clique nodes.

We assign truth values to the variables of Φ so that each literal labeling a clique node is made true.
Doing so is always possible because two nodes labeled in a contradictory way are not connected by an edge and hence both can't be in a clique.
This assignment to the variables satisfies Φ because each triple contains a clique node and hence each clause contains a literal that is 
assigned true.

Therefore Φ is satisfiable.
```

### 4. Defination Of NP-Completeness
A language is NP-Complete if it satisfies two conditions:  
- B is in NP  
- Every A in NP is polynomial time reducible to B.

#### - If B is NP-Complete and B <= C for C in NP, then C is NP-Complete
``` bash
Claim: If B is NP-Complete and B <= C for C in NP, then C is NP-Complete

Proof:

We alrady know that C is in NP, so we must show that every A in NP is a polynomial time reducile to C. 
Because B is NP-Complete, every language in NP is polynomial time reducible to B, and B in turn is polynomial time reducible to C. 

Polynomial time reductions compose; that is, 
if A is polynomial time reducible to B and B is polynomial time reducible to C, then A is polynomial time reducible to C.

Hence every language in NP is polynomial time reducible to C.
